# hudson contineous integration with buildout
# This is not integrated by default in others templates
# To add this support, just add the three parts to the etc/base.cfg
#    extends ...  hudson/bv.client/hudson.cfg  ...
#    parts += ...
#         bvclient_hudson_env
#         bvclient_hudson_job
#         bvclient_hudson_deploy
#
#
# Hudson is a tool tha allow us to make conteneous integration, see: http://hudson-ci.org/
# The scripts inside etc/hudson/build/*.sh are the scripts used as a build sequence for running our hudson job.
#
#
# We do 3 things there:
# - give a build sequence to update, build and test the project
# - a config.xml template file describing the hudson jpb (and what hudson is waiting for)
# - a part to deploy to an underlying tomat instance running in a minitage instance
#
#
# By default, you will have:
#
# etc/hudson
# |-- etc/hudson/bv.client/build/activate_env.sh              -> (generated) activate environment variables needed by other scripts
# |-- etc/hudson/bv.client/build/build.sh                     -> build the project (maybe also minitage dependencies)
# |-- etc/hudson/bv.client/build/test.sh                      -> run all needed test and produce reports inside parts/test/testreports n JUnit test xml format
# |-- etc/hudson/bv.client/build/update_mrdeveloper.sh        -> udpate sources grabbed via mr.developer
# |-- etc/hudson/bv.client/build/update_project.sh            -> udpate project code
# |-- etc/hudson/bv.client/config.xml                         -> an hudson config.xml job file
#
# etc/templates/hudson/
# |-- etc/templates/hudson/bv.client/build/activate_env.sh.in -> template to put things in the environment used during scripts execution
# `-- etc/templates/hudson/bv.client/config.xml.in            -> template for the job configuration to put inside your $HUDSON_HOME/jobs/bv.client/config.xml
#
#
# Deploy an hudson instance with minitage
# minitage/bin/paster create -t minitage.instances.tomcat bv.client --no-interactive
# minitage/bin/paster create -t minitage.instances.hudson bv.client --no-interactive
